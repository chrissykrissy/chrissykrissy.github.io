# Back-of-the-envelope Estimate

Question : estimate system capacity or performance requirement using a back-of-the-envelope estimation

- Need to understand 1) power of 2 2) latency numbers 3)availability numbers

### Power of two

- critical to know the data volume unit using the power of 2
    - byte = sequence of 8 bits
        - ex) ASCII character uses one byte of memory

### Latency numbers every programmer should know

Notes

---

ns = nanosecond

µs = microsecond

ms = millisecond

1 ns = 10^-9 seconds

1 µs= 10^-6 seconds = 1,000 ns

1 ms = 10^-3 seconds = 1,000 µs = 1,000,000 ns

Findings:

- Memory is fast but the disk is slow
- Avoid disk seeks if possible
- Simple compression algorithms are fast
- Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible
- Data centers are usually in different regions, and it takes time to send data between them

### Availability numbers

High availability = ability of a system to be continuously operational for desirably long period of time

- measured in percentages (100% = 0 downtime)

Service level agreement (SLA) 

- agreement between you (the service provider) and your customer that defines the level of uptime your service will deliver

Uptime → measured in nines

- the more the nines, the better
- the number of nines correlate to the expected system downtime

### Example : Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements

Assumptions:

- 300 million monthly active users.
- 50% of users use Twitter daily.
- Users post 2 tweets per day on average.
- 10% of tweets contain media.
- Data is stored for 5 years.

Estimations:

Query per second (QPS) estimate:

- Daily active users (DAU) = 300 million * 50% = 150 million
- Tweets QPS = 150 million * 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500
- Peek QPS = 2 * QPS = ~7000

We will only estimate media storage here.

- Average tweet size:
- tweet_id 64 bytes
- text 140 bytes
- media 1 MB
- Media storage: 150 million * 2 * 10% * 1 MB = 30 TB per day
- 5-year media storage: 30 TB * 365 * 5 = ~55 PB

### Tips

- Rounding and approximation
    - precision is not expected → use round numbers and approximation to your advantage
- Write down assumptions
- Label your units
    - remove ambiguity
- Commonly asked back-of-the-envelope estimations: QPS, peak QPS, storage, cache, number of servers, etc.
