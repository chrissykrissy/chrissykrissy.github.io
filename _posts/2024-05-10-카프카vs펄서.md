UnitedHealth Group 에서 일할때 우리 시스템에 메시징 시스템으로 Pulsar 를 씀

Pulsar는 Kafka 의 limitation 을 대응하기 위해? 등장

## Kafka의 Architecture

문제 : 새로운 Consumer/Instance 가 생길시, 메시지를 받을 partition 이 없음
- Kafka 를 초기 세팅시, throughput 과 # of instances 를 고려하여 partition 의 갯수를 정함
- partition 을 추가하는게 어려움
- partition 에 비용, limited partitions you can have per broker and cluster
- more partition = more problem bc more coordination needed
- what about increase number of brokers?
- when first added, the brokers are empty, need to transfer data in order to have them in full action
- to remove broker, remove partitions first

kafka - high availability by replicas


## Pulsar의 Architecture

How Pulsar solves these problems?

in scaling up, add new empty bookeeper, Brokers will start publish and read from that bookeeper, we don't have to move information between them

Brokers are stateless, not storing any data, only recieving messages and deciding which bookeepers they are going to send the data to and recieving data from consumer 
- when brokers are running hot, add more broker -> easy scaling up and down
- and scaling consumers easy too since no limitation to brokers

- more Kubernetes friendly


__Different Consuming patterns__
- Kafka only Shared & Key_Shared
- Pulsar also exclusive and failover
    - more flexibility

__Tiered storage \& Geo-Replication__
